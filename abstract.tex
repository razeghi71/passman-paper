\begin{abstract}

%Number of applications that require authentication is increasing every day and using the %same password for different services is considered as a security threat. On the other hand it's hard for a human being to memorize large amount of credentials. So password managers introduced to help users store and organize their passwords.

%Nowadays keyloggers are a serious threat for password manager softwares. If a keylogging software will be able to obtain users master password, then it can access all saved passwords.

%In this paper we propose a method to construct a password manager secured against keyloggers on GNU/Linux.
